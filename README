## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello my name is Muhamad Maulana Ihsan, a Nutritionist (a gonna be) and a programmer with 2 years exp (mainly web platform), which has a dream to simplified daily problems using technology. I am very open to the fast changing world of IT. As a programmer that utilised AI from the get go, has concluded that AI is not enemy but instead one of the best friend. With AI, a professional can seemingly clone itself into 10 people based on their performance and productivity. AI also can also offer a non profesional an opportunity to do something that they never believe can to do. In the right hand, AI will be a great tool to bring positive impact in the, including in health sector (specially in nutrition).
